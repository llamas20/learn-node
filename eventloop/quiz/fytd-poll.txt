- In eventloop/poll.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

It executes in the order foo, done, someAsyncOperation.  This is because foo and the console.log('done') are both synchronous.
The asynchronous operation does not execute until the callback queue is completed (the foo and the done).

The whole program runs on the main thread synchronously.  There's an I/O operation inside of someAsyncOperation.
It is sent to the polling phase for after the main thread completes.  Function foo and the console.log(done) are both
synchronous and are executed on the main thread.  Once that finishes, someAsyncOperation is executed.
